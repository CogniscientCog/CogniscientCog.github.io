### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    I liked Lab 4, Part 1 because of what it taught me. With most other labs, I was tasked with programming simple actions that I already knew how to perform in real life. However, this lab was the first time in recent memory that I heard of the Julian Day.

* Lab 11

    As much as I love a good challenge and abstract ideas, I liked Lab 11, Part 1 for its simple, easy-to-understand premise/task. All it was asking for was to find population densities and output the highest and lowest ones. It was a relief knowing that I did not have to think about the end goal during that part, because I was not very comfortable with working with CSV files at the time.

* Lab 12

    I liked Lab 12, Part 1 because it was one of the first times this semester that I stepped into new territory. I had studied a year of Java before this class, and had done very well. Thus, most of the labs I did tasked me with writing C++ code that I could directly translate over from my knowledge of Java.
